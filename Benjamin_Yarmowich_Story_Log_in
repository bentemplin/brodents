As a User, I want to login to the system, so that I can use the app.

Tasks:
    * Accept the User's inputted Username and Password
    * Search the database for the <key, value> pair of the Username and encrypted password hash
    * Grant or Deny access to app based on whether the pair is found
    * Offer a forgot password button to reset the password based on email authentication

Acceptance Scenarios:
    * Given there is a network connection, when the app is launched, app prompts log in.
    * Given the User enters a valid username and its corresponding password is in the database the main screen of the app is displayed
    * Given the User enters a valid username and its corresponding password is not in the database the User will be prompted with incorrect Username/Password combination
    * Given the User enters an invalid username the User will be prompted with incorrect Username/Password combination
    * Given the User enters 3 or more wrong username and password combination the User will be prompted to recover password and enter their email address or try again
    * Given the User enters 10 wrong username and password combination the User will be barred from entering a Username/Password for 1 hour

As a User, I want to logout of the system, so that I'm no longer logged into the app

Tasks:
	-Accept a button press to log out of the app
	-Return the log in screen after a successful log out

Acceptance Scenarios:
	-Given that the user is logged in, when the user presses the logout button, then the app logs the user out
	-Given that the user successfully logs out, when the user returns to the screen, then the app displays a new log in screen

Done Done Criteria:
	-App is tested and the logout completes both tasks effectively
	-Code is merged into the GitHub correctly

As the App, I need to access the stored information, so that I can retrieve User and Report information.

Tasks:
    * Create a MySQL Database on a remote server
    * Configure remote login on the database
    * Write a custom Java class to connect a java app to the database
    * Write a subclass that has the login credentials for the Rat App Database
    * Create a .jar file with the custom Java classes and add it to the Android Project

Acceptance Scenarios:
    * Given there is a network connection, when the app is launched, it connects to the database.
    * Given the app is connected, when a valid database query is made, results are returned.
    * Given the app is connected, when a valid database update is made, the database is updated.
    * Given there are valid user inputs, when a query or update is made, the statement is parameterized to prevent SQL injection.
    * Given there is no network connection, when the app is launched, a message is displayed saying that the app can't connect to the database.
    * Given the app is connected, when an invalid database query is made, a message is displayed saying how to fix the error and the query is not made.
    * Given the app is connected, when an invalid database update is made, a message is displayed saying how to fix the error and the update is not executed.

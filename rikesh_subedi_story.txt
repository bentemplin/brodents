As a User, I want to Register for an account, so that I can start reporting rats.

Tasks:
    * Implement a registration link on Log In page.
    * Create a registration form to gather user name, username, password, and location.
    * Query the database for an existing account with the given username.
    * Send credentials server-side if username not found.
    * Display notification showing success of account creation.
    * Redirect to main screen of the application.

Acceptance Scenarios:
    * Given the form is valid and complete, when the REGISTER button is pressed, an account is created in the database.
    * Given the form is not complete, when the REGISTER button is pressed, stay on the form and notify the user of missing information.
    * Given any state of the form, when the CANCEL button is pressed, return to the Log In page.
    * Given the user enters a username, when the user exits the field, text displays its validity.
    * Given the user enters an invalid username, when the form is submitted, stay on the form and notify the user of invalid information.
    * Given the user enters an invalid password, when the user exits the field, a reminder with password requirements will be displayed.
    * Given the user enters an invalid password, when the form is submitted, stay on the form and notify the user of password requirements.
